            <p>
                As part of our efforts to our corporate social responsibility, we believed that the best way would be to
                take advantage of the skills and knowledge we have as a team, hence the Graduate Trainee Program. The
                program aims to equip recent graduates with soft technical skills, experience and certifications
                required to begin a career in the IT industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the help of the different experts in our team, we put together a 9-month program that enhances an
                individual with capacity to begin their careers as a functional or technical consultant in Microsoft,
                Oracle, Database and Cloud & Infrastructure. The program entails very intensive training sessions with
                self-study materials, with assessments done at different times. In addition, with full supervision &
                guidance from our trainers, the trainee gets to experience practical challenging client environments
                within our clientele arena.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the end of the program, the trainees gain globally recognized certification throughout the program,
                and even more exciting, the successful trainees have a guaranteed chance of starting their careers as
                Kobby employees.
